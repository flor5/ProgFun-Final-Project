Problem Statement:
A program is required that involves betting numbers to win more numbers. In each
round, a random unique number from 1-6 will be outputted. The player then chooses
a number from 1-6 against their opponent who chooses a random number from 1-6.
Each number can only be used once per game. Show the numbers that are available
for player 1 to use each round. When the player submits their answer, show the
player the results of the round. The player who bet the largest number gets both
numbers and the random number will be added to the next random number in the next
round. The first player to 32 or with the highest score after 6 rounds wins the
game.
Example: Random Number: 4, Player 1: 5, Player 2: 4. Player 1 wins this round
         and gets 13 added to their score.


Nouns: numbers, round, random unique number, player, opponent, once per game,
       answer, results, largest number, score, same number, value, 32, game,
       highest score, 6 rounds

Verbs: involve, betting, outputted, chooses, used, submits, gets, added, wins,
       show
